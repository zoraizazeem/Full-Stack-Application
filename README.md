# Full-Stack-Application

** This is a beta and will need further developement**

This is my "What do I owe?" application.
This application consists of the front and backend, i.e. the UI and the dynamic server.


This is a productivity application.
I use this personally to record the amount of work I have done for each of the categories I have allotted myself. (i.e. business, work, exercise etc.) 

/What do I owe = The client side javascript and html.
/server = The server side javascript.

Packages/frameworks used here: node.js, express, monk, mongodb, cors and chart.js.
CSS styling from: https://bulma.io

As a prerequisite you will need to download mongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com.
And then create/use the database “test”. Your data will then be stored locally (when you start the mongo server) into the collection “mydata”.

Further features needed to be added/expored and with more polish this is ready to be deployed.
